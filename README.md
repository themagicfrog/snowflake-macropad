# Snowpad

This is a 3x3 macropad themed snow for Hack Club's Blueprint/Hackpad/Prototype. I like keyboards a lot and also it's winter which is why I chose to
make it winter-themed with the snowflake silkscreen, and the blue and white coloring on the 3D case. It also has a rotary encoder for things like adjusting volume. This was fun to make!
